# MINE TIME

_Note: This project is not finished_

MineTime is a online Time Management Tool for projects.

This is a pet project for using Spring with Kotlin.

## How it works
You can sign up and create projects. Then you can send invitations to people who can sign
up too, if they aren't yet.

You can create categories and you and your members can manage your time spent on the
project. Then it will provide you with fancy statistics about your project.
